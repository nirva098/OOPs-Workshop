    "When Alan Kay coined the term __\"object oriented\"__, the picture that he had in mind was that software systems would be _structured_ like __biological system__. You would have something like individual cells (\"objects\") which interact with each other by sending something analogous to chemical signals (\"messages\"). You couldn't (or, at least, wouldn't) peer inside a cell; you would only interact with it via the signalling paths. Moreover, you could have more than one of each kind of cell if you needed to."
